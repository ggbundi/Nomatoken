# 🚀 NomaToken DApp - Ready for cPanel Deployment

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESS

Your NomaToken DApp has been successfully built and exported for static deployment to cPanel!

## 🔧 Issues Resolved

### 1. JavaScript Syntax Error Fixed
- **Problem**: Radix UI Progress component was causing a "SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list" during the build process
- **Solution**: Replaced the problematic Radix UI Progress component with a custom, lightweight Progress component
- **Result**: Build now completes successfully without syntax errors

### 2. Dependency Conflicts Resolved
- **Problem**: Peer dependency conflicts between date-fns versions and TypeScript versions
- **Solution**: Used `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to resolve conflicts
- **Result**: All dependencies installed successfully

### 3. Export Configuration Updated
- **Problem**: Using deprecated `next export` command
- **Solution**: Updated package.json to use only `next build` since `output: 'export'` is configured in next.config.js
- **Result**: Proper static export generation

The static files are ready in the `/out` directory:
